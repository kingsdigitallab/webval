# webval

A [Web application](https://kingsdigitallab.github.io/webval/) hosted on gthub that lets you run accessibility evaluation on a multiple pages for a collection of sites. The accessibility issues are saved in this repository and can be brosed and manually annotated to facilitate accessibility assessment, review and testing processes.

WCAG 2.1 A & AA issues are detected using Pa11y tool (html_cs engine and soon axe-core). **Note that automated detection only covers part of WCAG rules**.

## TODO

* add axe-core engine
* improve manual annotations
* assist with report & assessment generation
* ability to manage issues not coveredby automated testers
* documentation (how to add new project, etc.)
